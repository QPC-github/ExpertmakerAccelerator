**The Expertmaker Accelerator has been upgraded and moved.**

To break out functionality and simplify installation, it is now in
three separate repositories as below.  Please use code and documents
from these locations:

1.    https://github.com/eBay/accelerator-project_skeleton
2.    https://github.com/eBay/accelerator-gzutil
3.    https://github.com/eBay/accelerator

The purpose of the Accelerator project is to allow for fast data
processing with big data. Extensive documentation on the purpose and
how to use the Accelerator projects is covered in the reference manual
found here:
